Statistical Concepts Covered
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and analyzing data to understand its patterns. Examples include:

Mean, Median, Mode
Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
Quartiles, Skewness, Kurtosis
Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics allows you to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on sample data. Examples include:

Confidence Intervals
Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA)
Chi-Square Tests
Probability
We explore basic probability concepts such as:

Probability Distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson)
Conditional Probability
Bayes' Theorem
Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between variables. Topics include:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Multiple Regression
Hypothesis Testing
This section covers various hypothesis testing techniques including:

One-sample t-test
Two-sample t-test
Paired t-test
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Machine Learning
We also provide statistical methods used in machine learning, including:

Linear Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)
Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-means)
Decision Trees and Random Forests
Code Examples
Mean, Median, Mode
